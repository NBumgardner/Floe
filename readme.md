# Floe

This is an action-puzzle game created by a team of students in Missouri State University's Computer Science department.

## Overview

Help Floe, the spirit of ice, bring winter to the land by freezing over lakes. There are a number of different enemies that stand in your path, however, and they aren't happy about Floe's intrusion on their territory. 

*Version 1.0* - [Play Here!](http://SamBumgardner.Github.io/Floe)

## Getting Started

To build and run Floe, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org/download), [Haxepunk](http://www.haxepunk.com), and [OpenFL](http://www.openfl.org/download/) installed on your computer.
2. Open a command prompt in `/Floe/Floe/`.
3. Run the command `lime test flash` to build and run the executable.
  * The executable is located in `/Floe/Floe/bin/flash/bin/`.
  * To run in debug mode, run the command `lime test -debug flash`. Then access the debug console with the backquote key.

Past demos of Floe are in [SavedBinFiles](SavedBinFiles/readme.md) for posterity.

## Useful Notes

* All controls are keyboard-based. 
 * Use the arrow keys to change menu selections and move Floe.
 * Use spacebar/enter to interact with the menu.
 * Anything else should be pretty self-explanatory.
* Freeze all water tiles in the level to move on to the next.
* Avoid all enemies.
* **Debug Mode:** Use the `d` key to damage yourself, use `n` to advance to the next level.
