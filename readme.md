# Floe

This is an action-puzzle game created by a team of students in Missouri State University's Computer Science department.

### Overview

Help Floe, the spirit of ice, bring winter to the land by freezing over lakes. There are a number of different enemies that stand in your path, however, and they aren't happy about Floe's intrusion on their territory.
